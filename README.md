SimpleMathParser

This repository includes scripts in Ruby and Java, that provide a simple maths parser
that takes a specific input and calculates the result, without giving precendence to
operators, other than braces. The equation is literally evaluated from left to right.

The requirement for this was set outside the scope of the repository, and is purposefully
meant to exclude prefix/infix/postfix solutions to standard equation evaluation.
